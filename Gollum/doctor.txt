    reasmb: Here is a riddle. Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters.
    reasmb: Here is a riddle. It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. it lies behind stars and under hills, and empty holes it fills. it comes first and follows after, ends life, kills laughter.
    reasmb: Here is a riddle. Alive without breath, as cold as death; never thirsty, ever drinking, all in mail never clinking.
    reasmb: This thing all things devours - birds, beasts, trees, flowers; gnaws iron, bites steel; grinds hard stones to meal; slays king, ruins town, and beats high mountain down.
